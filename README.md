# StardockKeyGenerator
This tool is aimed at automating the trial license generation for Stardock programs. Currently, it is heavily focused on Start 11 / WindowBlinds 11 but I would like to expand it's features to include other apps.

The repo can be built and published in Visual Studio using .NET 9.0 SDK. This will output a standalone EXE.
```
dotnet publish
```
